# Opening Layers

Layers display geographic information on a map as layer. The layers are displayed in different formats, shapes or icons such as images, tiles, icons, etc. Layers control the way a user sees different classes of information and how to apply a layer on a map. There are multiple layers used to monitor, track or provide visualization on what's happening around the City of Chicago. Layers also provide information about the area of where the layers overlay. To apply a layer on a map, hover on the layer icon; once a layer has appeared select a layer type and expand the layer by collapsing all possible layers within its category.
