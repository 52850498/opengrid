## OpenGrid Configuration

One easy way to customize OpenGrid's behavior is to set the various available configuration options in `src/js/custom/Config.js`.

The settings are described below.

### Available Settings
#### brand
* *applicationName* - application name used on login screen, window title, and top navigation pane
* *copyright* - placeholder for copyright information; not currently used by application (internal use only)
* *version* - placeholder for version info; notcurrently  used by application (internal use only)

#### session
* *timeout* - session timeout, in minutes; if no user activity is detected (including mouse, keyboard and query requests) within this 
time period, the user is automatically logged out and redirected to the login screen
* *tokenRenewalInterval* - token renewal interval in minutes; the application uses tokens to securely send credential information 
to the service layer; the security token is originally generated by the service and has an expiration (4 hours by default); this setting should 
be set to a value less than the expiration period on the service side to prevent any session interruptions (permission errors) caused by
expired token
