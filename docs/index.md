# OpenGrid

An open-source geospatial situational awareness platform.

---

This documentation provides a wide overview of OpenGrid, from how to explore data to detailed API documentation. 

### Real-time and Historical spatial analysis

OpenGrid excels at providing either real-time or historical insights of event-based data. Whether it's 311 calls, crimes, 911 calls, Tweets or other data sources, if data has a time and location, 

OpenGrid can be used for real-time data analysis, refreshing frequently to provide the most up-to-date information. It also allows users to reach back into time to look at past events.

### Technical architecture

OpenGrid is designed to be flexible with different types of data sources. Whether it's MongoDB, a RESTful API, or other data sources, programmers can use OpenGrid's API and "service layer" to program it to work with other data sources.

### Open Source

Open source gives "OpenGrid" its name. Feel free to use it, contribute to it, or change it. Just please take a look at the project's <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license</a>.
